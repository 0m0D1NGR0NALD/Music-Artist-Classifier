# Music Artist Classifier Using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
This project aims to classify music tracks based on the artist that created them, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
CNNs are a type of deep neural network that are commonly used for image classification tasks, but can also be applied to other types of data, including audio.
## Installation
To use this project, you will need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine, along with the following libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
TensorFlow
Keras
